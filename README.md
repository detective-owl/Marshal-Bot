# Marshal Bot 
##### :trophy: 1st Place Thales Canada Project Arduino 2017-2018

Marshal Bot is an automated aircraft marshalling system capable of correcting an aircraft's position when parking. Marshal is built on the Arduino platform and uses ultrasonic sensors along with four servo motors to detect the aircraft's orientation and signal the correct marshalling signals to the pilot. The movements of the robot imitates a human which allows pilots to recognize the signals, correcting the aircrafts position in realtime.
