An aircraft marshalling robot that detects an aircrafts orientation and distance to autonomously display commands to assist the pilot in correcting the aircraft. The project uses the Arduino microcontroller, IR distance sensors, and servo motors to produce a working prototype. Glowsticks are used to emulate the aircraft marshals light up sticks.
