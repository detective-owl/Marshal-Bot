An aircraft marshaling robot that detects an aircraft's orientation and distance to autonomously display commands to assist the pilot in correcting the aircraft. The project uses the Arduino micro-controller, IR distance sensors, and servo motors to produce a working prototype. Glow-sticks are used to emulate the aircraft marshals light up sticks.
